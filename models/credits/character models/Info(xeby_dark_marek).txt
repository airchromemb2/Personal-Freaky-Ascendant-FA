When i started on May 16 2014 09:25 PM, to create this model no one seems to care about it !
Until the help come from @RevanKnight then later in 2016 the sounds come from @Kylo Ren.
The beta model is no longer available (the black color). Maybe some users from JKhub still 
have it because i give it for testing, long time ago.
The actual model is finish (silver/metallic color) but my animations are not ! 
Because of many requests of the costume i will release for free, 
without the animations and other force effects.

The costume inspiration is from TFU2. 
In my opinion this costume is the best for StarKiller/Galen Marek. 

For StarKiller's lightsaber you can try this:

For single backhand animation you can try this:

For double backhand animation you can try this:
