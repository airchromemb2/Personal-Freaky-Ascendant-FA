Description:
---------------------------------------------------------
The Sith Stalker Armor was a type of armor that was cybernetically grafted to the wearer, 
covering the entire body save the arms. Painfully grafted onto the wearer's flesh and bone, was meant to transform 
dark side disciples into powerful Sith assassins. It had an intimidating appearance that was designed to inspire fear in any enemy


Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------
Simply place "DS_sith_stalker_SP.pk3" into your game's base folder.


Notes
---------------------------------------------------------
Most obvious bug is clipping, it ain't perfect but still loads of fun, 
if you want perfection, buy force unleashed! :P

The custom hilt included has a custom "hum" sound that 
emulates the sith stalker life support system. If you want to get 
rid of it, edit the saber file to point to a default sound from the game.

To use this model in single player:

First select as your species along with your favorite lightsaber (i recommend the one included!). If you want a more powerful character bring down the console (with shift + tilde) and type: 

playermodel sith_stalker 

you should now have improved force powers and red lightsaber.
Note: For some reason the taunts don't seem to always work in Single player =/
