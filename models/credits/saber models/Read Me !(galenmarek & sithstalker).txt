CHANGES AND ADDITIONS FOR V2 :
-I've added the Sith Stalker lightsaber hilt
-a regular sinle saber version of Galens lightsaber was added
-File size has been reduced by converting the TGA textures to JPEG/PNG files
-all included lightsabers have single player support now !!! (SP support is in a seeperate PK3 cause people who use a SP TC ,like KOTF, will have trouble with the SP support)
